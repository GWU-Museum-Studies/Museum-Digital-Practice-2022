We live in a society that is fully immersed in technology. It’s used to communicate, complete work both professional and educational, bring joy and entertainment, among a slew of other purposes. It has become very difficult to go through the average day without using technology. This was the status quo, until the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world. Many people were home bound and if you were in a public space, you were strongly encouraged to practice social distancing. This brought much worry to businesses that thrive off public interaction, museums being a significant example. If businesses and institutions didn’t think quickly about how they were going to continue to reach their audience from their homes, they risked the institution shutting down indefinitely. Schools also had to worry about how they were going to educate their students from their homes, and thus began the immediate rise of online learning, creating new opportunities for museums. 

When first introduced, online learning was looked at as a “poor substitute for the traditional classroom learning.”[^1] Luckily, with the advancement of technology and the internet, web-based learning has significantly improved, thus becoming a useful tool for museums and their outreach initiatives. It became clear that if students could effectively learn from home temporarily, so could museum patrons that missed wandering around their favorite museums. The pandemic and online learning also allowed for those who didn’t have the means or ability to visit these locations to still get valuable information, which significantly broadened institutions’ audiences. To reach these broader audiences, some museums have begun offering distance learning programs. These programs allow museums to increase their reach through technology that is becoming more ubiquitous. In 2021, when discussing museum education in general, the American Alliance of Museums stated that in the “United States, museums spend more than $2 billion a year on education...[and] provide more than 18 million instructional hours for educational programs.” This statistic shows that museums across the nation have put in a great deal of time, energy, and money to effectively run educational programs that’ll best serve the public. Once it became clear that there was a population of adults who were interested in visiting museums but did not have the access, many museums opted to redirect their focus and money towards online/virtual learning.
