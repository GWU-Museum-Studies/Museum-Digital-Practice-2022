The full post from u/trilliumleaf reads “Hello! I work in exhibition design, and I have been tasked with creating a report about the different ways museums are currently using QR codes. If you have QR codes at your museum, how are they being utilized? How have you seen other museums using QR codes? (Any visuals would be incredibly helpful as well!!) Some of the information I'm looking for: Do QR codes accompany individual objects or do visitors scan a QR code at the entrance of a gallery? For individual objects, are QR codes part of the wall label? What instructions/explanation accompany the QR codes (ex: “Scan this to hear x talk about y”)? Any information or insight would be much appreciated! Thank you :)”"
